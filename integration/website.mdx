## Step 1: Create a Payment Link 

Payment links are the easiest way to start accepting payments. They can be created through the Paycrypt Dashboard or programmatically using our API.

1.  **Log in to your [Paycrypt Dashboard](https://paycrypt.tech)**
2.  **Navigate to "Payment" > "Create Payment Link"** on the left sidebar.
3.  **Fill in the payment details as shown in the image:**
    *   **Title:** Enter a descriptive name for your payment link, e.g., "Demo store".
    *   **Amount Settings:** Select the currency (e.g., USD) and enter the amount (e.g., 100).
    *   **Link Settings:** Configure how long the payment link remains active (e.g., PERMANENT).
    *   **Description (Optional):** Add a description visible to your customers, e.g., "This is a demo store".
    *   **Redirect URL (Optional):** Specify a URL where customers will be redirected after payment, e.g., `https://example.com`.
    *   **Collect customer info:** Choose what information to collect from your customers. In the example, "Collect email" is checked.
4.  **Click "Create Payment Link"**.
5.  **Copy the generated payment link**. This link can be shared with customers or used in your website's payment button.


## Step 2: Set Up Webhooks

Webhooks allow you to receive real-time notifications about payment events. Here's how to set them up:

1.  **Go to your [Paycrypt Dashboard](https://paycrypt.tech)**
2.  **Navigate to "Settings" > "Webhooks"** on the left sidebar
3.  **Click "Add Endpoint"** button
4.  **Enter your webhook URL** in the provided field
5.  **Create webhook secret** (this will be used to verify the webhook signature)
    *   Make sure to store this secret securely, as it will be used in your server code to verify incoming webhook requests
6.  **Click "Add Endpoint"** to complete the setup


## Step 3: Verify Webhook Signatures
To ensure the security of your webhook events, you need to verify the signature of incoming webhook requests. Here's how to do it:

```typescript
import { NextResponse } from "next/server";
import prisma from "../../lib/db";

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  try {
    // Verify webhook signature
    const signature = request.headers.get("X-Webhook-Signature");
    const webhookSecret = process.env.WEBHOOK_SECRET;

    if (!signature || !webhookSecret || signature !== webhookSecret) {
      return NextResponse.json(
        { error: "Invalid webhook signature" },
        { status: 401 }
      );
    }

    const body = await request.json();
    const { email } = body;

    console.log(body);
    if (!email) {
      return NextResponse.json({ error: "Email is required" }, { status: 400 });
    }

    // Find the user by email and update their status to Pro
    const user = await prisma.user.update({
      where: { email },
      data: { isPro: true },
    });

    if (!user) {
      return NextResponse.json({ error: "User not found" }, { status: 404 });
    }

    return NextResponse.json({
      success: true,
      message: "User upgraded to Pro successfully",
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error upgrading user:", error);
    return NextResponse.json(
      { error: "Failed to upgrade user" },
      { status: 500 }
    );
  }
}
```

This example shows how to:
1. Verify the webhook signature using the `X-Webhook-Signature` header
2. Process the webhook payload
3. Update user status in your database
4. Return appropriate responses

## Step 4: Add Payment Button to Your Website

You can add a payment button to your website in two ways:

### Option 1: Using the Checkout Link

1.  **Copy your payment link** from [Step 1: Create a Payment Link](##step-1-create-a-payment-link)
2.  **Add the link to your website**:

```html
<a href="https://sandbox.pay.paycrypt.tech/link/1c90b6bc-8031-406c-98cd-812668383559?email=yfw111realone@gmail.com" class="paycrypt-button">
  Pay Now
</a>
```
### Option 2: Using the Paycrypt Button Component (coming soon)

1.  **Install the Paycrypt SDK** using pnpm:

```bash
pnpm add @paycrypt/sdk
```

2.  **Add the button to your React component**:

```javascript
import { PaycryptButton } from '@paycrypt/sdk';

function CheckoutPage() {
  return (
    <PaycryptButton
      amount={100}
      currency="USD"
      onSuccess={(payment) => {
        console.log('Payment successful:', payment);
      }}
      onError={(error) => {
        console.error('Payment failed:', error);
      }}
    />
  );
}
```
